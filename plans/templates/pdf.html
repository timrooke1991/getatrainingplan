                <p>
                    I'm so pumped you've decided to take on the mighty marathon. I know the distance seems daunting now, but with smart training and determination, you've so got this!
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="dark-text underline blue">Base Building:</span>
                        <br>
                        Establish a solid aerobic base with enough weekly mileage at an easy pace. This builds endurance and prepares the body for harder training. Start with around 40% of peak weekly volume.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="dark-text underline red">Long Runs</span>
                        <br>
                        Do a weekly long run starting around 10 miles building up to 20+ miles. Long runs build endurance and mentally prepare for the marathon distance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="dark-text underline yellow">Speedwork</span>
                        <br>
                        Incorporate tempo runs, intervals, fartleks. These help improve lactate threshold, running economy and speed. Include 1-2 speed sessions per week.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <br>
                        Have easy run days and complete rest days. These allow the body to adapt to training and prevent injury and burnout. Reduce mileage every 4 weeks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="dark-text underline red">Progression</span>
                        <br>
                        Gradually increase total weekly mileage by around 10% each week, up to a peak of 40-50 mpw. Increase long run by 1-2 miles each week.
                    </li>

                        Include marathon pace runs. Run portions of long runs at goal marathon pace. Practice race day fueling and gear. Mimic race day conditions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="dark-text underline blue">Taper</span>
                        <br>
                        Reduce volume by 25-50% over 2-3 weeks pre-race while maintaining intensity. Allows legs to feel fresh and rested for race day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="dark-text underline red">Periodization</span>
                        <br>
                        Vary training in cycles by adjusting volume, intensity and recovery. Cycle between hard and easy weeks.
                    </li>

                        <br>
                        1-2 times per week for injury prevention and running efficiency. Focus on core, hips, glutes and legs.
                    </li>

                        <span class="dark-text underline blue">Stretching</span>
                        <br>
                        Stretch regularly post-run to increase flexibility and prevent injury. Focus on major running muscle groups.
                    </li>

                        Eat a balanced diet high in complex carbs, lean protein and healthy fats. Hydrate well before, during and after runs.

                    SESSIONS
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Varied paced runs make training more comprehensive, adaptive, safe and tailored to the specific demands of marathon racing. Following a plan with purposeful variety is key to being successful over any distance.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="dark-text underline blue">Intervals</span>
                        <br>
                        Intervals involve repeating shorter, faster runs with recovery periods in between. Intervals help improve speed and lactate threshold. A sample interval workout may be 6x800m at 5K pace with 400m recovery jog.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="dark-text underline red">Fartlek</span>
                        <br>
                        A Fartlek run alternates faster segments with recovery periods, but in a non-structured way based on how you feel. Fartleks work on speed with less monotony. A sample fartlek may push the pace for 2 minutes, jog for 1, surge again for 3, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="dark-text underline yellow">Long Runs</span>
                        <br>
                        Long runs are 1.5-3+ hours at an easy, conversational pace. They build endurance and mental stamina needed for the marathon distance. Long runs typically make up 20-30% of weekly mileage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="dark-text underline blue">Recovery Runs</span>
                        <br>
                        Recovery runs are short, slow runs usually done the day after a hard workout. They flush muscles, facilitate recovery, and prevent injury while adding mileage. Keep effort very easy on these runs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="dark-text underline red">Tempo</span>
                        <br>
                        Tempo runs are steady, moderately-hard efforts run at lactate threshold pace. They build speed and efficiency at race pace. A sample tempo may be 3-5 miles at marathon pace or slightly faster.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="dark-text underline yellow">Progression Runs</span>
                        <br>
                        Progression runs start easy and gradually build to a faster pace throughout the run. They help improve stamina and get the body accustomed to holding faster paces. A sample progression run may be 6 miles starting at an aerobic pace and finishing at marathon pace.
                    </li>
